# Combinations

## Definition:

 Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers chosen from the range [1, n].
You may return the answer in any order.

## Constrains:

1 <= n <= 20
1 <= k <= 20

## Examples

### Example 1:

_*Input*_: n = 4, k = 2
_*Output*_: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
_Explanation_: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.
Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.

### Example 2:
_Input_: n = 1, k = 1
_Output_: [[1]]
_Explanation_: There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.
